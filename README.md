- This website design is based on [STA 363 by Dr. Lucy D’Agostino McGowan](https://sta-363-s23.github.io/website/), who used materials from [ESPM-157 by Carl Boettinger](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/), [Sta199 by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring18/Sta199/), and [PMAP 8521 by Andrew Heiss](https://evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com).

Materials also were used from [Math 154 y Jo Hardin](https://m154-comp-stats.netlify.app/)

- I used course structure and policies based on courses by two EXPERTS:
  - [Sta199 by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring18/Sta199/)
  - [Math 154 by Jo Hardin](https://m154-comp-stats.netlify.app/)

- The hex is designed by [Tyler George](https://stats-tgeorge.github.io/personal_website/about.html). It uses a Gentoo penguin image by Pygoscelis papua, an Adelie penguin photo by Andrew Shiva, and an Chinstrap penguin photo by Steve (Billy) Barton, along with the [Palmer Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) data.
