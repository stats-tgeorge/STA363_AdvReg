    "section": "AI Policy",
    "text": "AI Policy\nThe beta release of Dall-E-Mini in July 2022 and ChatGPT in November 2022 are among many tools using artificial intelligence. There is a good possibility that using tools like these are going to become an important skill for careers in the not distant future (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/07/chatgpt-bot-excel-ai-chatbot-tech).\nIn the meantime though, it’s going to take a while for society to figure out when using these tools is/isn’t acceptable.\nWork created by AI tools may not be considered original work and, instead, considered automated plagiarism. It is derived from previously created texts from other sources that the models were trained on, yet doesn’t cite sources. AI models have built-in biases (ie, they are trained on limited underlying sources; they reproduce, rather than challenge, errors in the sources) AI tools have limitations (ie, they lack critical thinking to evaluate and reflect on criteria; they lack abductive reasoning to make judgments with incomplete information at hand; they make up or use inaccurate information and may “hallucinate” sources that do not exist)\nIn this course, all informal writing should be written without the use of AI. The purpose of informal writing is to help you think through your ideas, connect with your lived experiences, and to figure out your thoughts and opinions. Using AI here subverts that process.\nA final note: Other courses may have different AI policies, and it is important to be aware of the policy in each class.\n\nDISABILITIES AND ACCOMODATIONS POLICY\nCornell College makes reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities. Students should notify the Office of Academic Support and Advising and their course instructor of any disability related accommodations within the first three days of the term for which the accommodations are required, due to the fast pace of the block format. For more information on the documentation required to establish the need for accommodations and the process of requesting the accommodations.\n\n\nACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY\nCornell College expects all members of the Cornell community to act with academic integrity. An important aspect of academic integrity is respecting the work of others. A student is expected to explicitly acknowledge ideas, claims, observations, or data of others, unless generally known. When a piece of work is submitted for credit, a student is asserting that the submission is her or his work unless there is a citation of a specific source. If there is no appropriate acknowledgment of sources, whether intended or not, this may constitute a violation of the College’s requirement for honesty in academic work and may be treated as a case of academic dishonesty. The procedures regarding how the College deals with cases of academic dishonesty appear in The Catalog, under the heading “Academic Honesty.”\n\n\nIllness Policy\nIf you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, do not attend class. Perform a home test or contact Director of Student Health Services Lynn O’Brien at student_health@cornellcollege.edu immediately to arrange a COVID-19 test at the Health Center. If you need to isolate due to COVID-19, or if you become unable to attend class for any other health reason, contact me as soon as possible to determine if you are able to continue in the class. A Withdrawal for Health Reasons may be required.\n\n\nMandatory Reporter Reminder\nIt is my goal that you feel supported and able to share information related to your life experiences during classroom discussions, in your written work, and in any one-on-one meetings with me. You should also know that all Cornell College faculty and staff are mandatory reporters. This means that I will keep information you share with me private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to share information regarding sexual assault, abuse, criminal behavior, or about a student who may be a danger to themselves or to others. If you wish to speak to someone confidentially who is not a mandatory reporter, you can schedule an appointment with one of the counselors in the Ebersole Health and Wellbeing Center or contact the College Chaplain, Rev. Melea White, at mwhite@cornelllcollege.edu.",

    "text": "Example: Sex discrimination in bank salaries. In the 1970’s, Harris Trust was sued for sex discrimination in the salaries it paid its employees. One approach to addressing this issue was to examine the starting salaries of all skilled, entry-level clerical workers between 1965 and 1975. The data is saved under banksalary.csv, and relevant R code can be found in the STA363_inst_files folder on the home directory of the RStudio Server. banksalary.qmd.\nFirst, we will speculate on what we expect to find and then we will perform an analysis using the data.\nRead the data in and use aview() to see the data, but do not do anything else with the data on the computer until question 6.\n\nIdentify the observational units, the response variable, and explanatory variables.\nGiven the mean starting salary of male workers ($5957) was 16% higher than the mean starting salary of female workers ($5139): Is this enough evidence to conclude sex discrimination exists? If not, what further evidence would you need?\nHow would you expect age, experience, and education to each be related to starting salary?\nWhy might it be important to control for seniority (number of years with the bank) if we are only concerned with the salary when the worker started?\nDo you expect any explanatory variables (including sex) to be closely related to each other? What implications would this have for modeling?\n\nUsing the data…\nOne approach is to construct a good model for beginning salaries while requiring sex as a predictor, to determine the significance of sex after controlling for the other covariates. Then we can explore interactions with sex to see if its effect is consistent across levels of other predictors.\n\nUse the data to address the primary question of interest here using only the beginning salary and sex variables. Be sure to discuss plots and summary statistics first, and then look at test(s) of significance.\nConstruct plots to investigate how each of the potential confounders (age, experience, education) is related to beginning salaries. Describe your findings.\nDoes seniority play a role in the variation of starting salaries? In what way?\nExamine how the explanatory variables (including sex) are related to each other, if at all. What implications would this have for modeling?\nFit a simple linear regression model with starting salary as the response and education as the sole explanatory variable. Interpret the intercept and slope of this model; also interpret the R-squared value. Is there a significant relationship between education and starting salary?\n\nIntercept:\nSlope:\nR2\nSignificance:\n\nDoes model1 from question 10 meet all linear regression assumptions? List each assumption and how you decided if it was met or not.\nIs a model with all 4 confounding variables better than a model with just education? Justify with an appropriate significance test in addition to summary statistics of model performance.\nYou should have noticed that the term for age was not significant in the model3. What does this imply about age and about future modeling steps?\nThe relationship between experience and beginning salary exhibits some curvature. How might it be interpreted in this context? Determine whether a quadratic term in experience improves a model without curvature.\nBased on model6, what conclusions can be drawn about sex discrimination at Harris Trust? Do these conclusions have to be qualified at all, or are they pretty clear cut? Interpret a 95% confidence interval for the male indicator variable in context to help with your response.\nDo any explanatory variables exhibit an interaction with sex. If so, what are the implications for your answer in (15)?\nOften salary data is logged before analysis. Would you recommend logging starting salary in this study? Support your decision analytically.\nRegardless of your answer to (17), provide an interpretation for the coefficient for the male coefficient in model6a after logging starting salary."

One approach to addressing this issue was to examine the starting salaries of all skilled, entry-level clerical workers between 1965 and 1975. The data is saved under banksalary.csv, and relevant R code can be found in the STA363_inst_files folder on the home directory of the RStudio Server. banksalary.qmd.\nFirst, we will speculate on what we expect to find and then we will perform an analysis using the data.\n\nRead the data in and use aview() to see the data, but do not do anything else with the data on the computer until question 6."

    "section": "Questions",
    "text": "Questions\n\nIdentify the observational units, the response variable, and explanatory variables.\nGiven the mean starting salary of male workers ($5957) was 16% higher than the mean starting salary of female workers ($5139): Is this enough evidence to conclude sex discrimination exists? If not, what further evidence would you need?\nHow would you expect age, experience, and education to each be related to starting salary?\nWhy might it be important to control for seniority (number of years with the bank) if we are only concerned with the salary when the worker started?\nDo you expect any explanatory variables (including sex) to be closely related to each other? What implications would this have for modeling?\n\nUsing the data…\nOne approach is to construct a good model for beginning salaries while requiring sex as a predictor, to determine the significance of sex after controlling for the other covariates. Then we can explore interactions with sex to see if its effect is consistent across levels of other predictors.\n\nUse the data to address the primary question of interest here using only the beginning salary and sex variables. Be sure to discuss plots and summary statistics first, and then look at test(s) of significance.\nConstruct plots to investigate how each of the potential confounders (age, experience, education) is related to beginning salaries. Describe your findings.\nDoes seniority play a role in the variation of starting salaries? In what way?\nExamine how the explanatory variables (including sex) are related to each other, if at all. What implications would this have for modeling?\nFit a simple linear regression model with starting salary as the response and education as the sole explanatory variable. Interpret the intercept and slope of this model; also interpret the R-squared value. Is there a significant relationship between education and starting salary?\n\nIntercept:\nSlope:\nR2\nSignificance:\n\nDoes model1 from question 10 meet all linear regression assumptions? List each assumption and how you decided if it was met or not.\nIs a model with all 4 confounding variables better than a model with just education? Justify with an appropriate significance test in addition to summary statistics of model performance.\nYou should have noticed that the term for age was not significant in the model3. What does this imply about age and about future modeling steps?\nThe relationship between experience and beginning salary exhibits some curvature. How might it be interpreted in this context? Determine whether a quadratic term in experience improves a model without curvature.\nBased on model6, what conclusions can be drawn about sex discrimination at Harris Trust? Do these conclusions have to be qualified at all, or are they pretty clear cut? Interpret a 95% confidence interval for the male indicator variable in context to help with your response.\nDo any explanatory variables exhibit an interaction with sex. If so, what are the implications for your answer in (15)?\nOften salary data is logged before analysis. Would you recommend logging starting salary in this study? Support your decision analytically.\nRegardless of your answer to (17), provide an interpretation for the coefficient for the male coefficient in model6a after logging starting salary."
