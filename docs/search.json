    "section": "AI Policy",
    "text": "AI Policy\nThe beta release of Dall-E-Mini in July 2022 and ChatGPT in November 2022 are among many tools using artificial intelligence. There is a good possibility that using tools like these are going to become an important skill for careers in the not distant future (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/07/chatgpt-bot-excel-ai-chatbot-tech).\nIn the meantime though, it’s going to take a while for society to figure out when using these tools is/isn’t acceptable.\nWork created by AI tools may not be considered original work and, instead, considered automated plagiarism. It is derived from previously created texts from other sources that the models were trained on, yet doesn’t cite sources. AI models have built-in biases (ie, they are trained on limited underlying sources; they reproduce, rather than challenge, errors in the sources) AI tools have limitations (ie, they lack critical thinking to evaluate and reflect on criteria; they lack abductive reasoning to make judgments with incomplete information at hand; they make up or use inaccurate information and may “hallucinate” sources that do not exist)\nIn this course, all informal writing should be written without the use of AI. The purpose of informal writing is to help you think through your ideas, connect with your lived experiences, and to figure out your thoughts and opinions. Using AI here subverts that process.\nA final note: Other courses may have different AI policies, and it is important to be aware of the policy in each class.\n\nDISABILITIES AND ACCOMODATIONS POLICY\nCornell College makes reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities. Students should notify the Office of Academic Support and Advising and their course instructor of any disability related accommodations within the first three days of the term for which the accommodations are required, due to the fast pace of the block format. For more information on the documentation required to establish the need for accommodations and the process of requesting the accommodations.\n\n\nACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY\nCornell College expects all members of the Cornell community to act with academic integrity. An important aspect of academic integrity is respecting the work of others. A student is expected to explicitly acknowledge ideas, claims, observations, or data of others, unless generally known. When a piece of work is submitted for credit, a student is asserting that the submission is her or his work unless there is a citation of a specific source. If there is no appropriate acknowledgment of sources, whether intended or not, this may constitute a violation of the College’s requirement for honesty in academic work and may be treated as a case of academic dishonesty. The procedures regarding how the College deals with cases of academic dishonesty appear in The Catalog, under the heading “Academic Honesty.”\n\n\nIllness Policy\nIf you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, do not attend class. Perform a home test or contact Director of Student Health Services Lynn O’Brien at student_health@cornellcollege.edu immediately to arrange a COVID-19 test at the Health Center. If you need to isolate due to COVID-19, or if you become unable to attend class for any other health reason, contact me as soon as possible to determine if you are able to continue in the class. A Withdrawal for Health Reasons may be required.\n\n\nMandatory Reporter Reminder\nIt is my goal that you feel supported and able to share information related to your life experiences during classroom discussions, in your written work, and in any one-on-one meetings with me. You should also know that all Cornell College faculty and staff are mandatory reporters. This means that I will keep information you share with me private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to share information regarding sexual assault, abuse, criminal behavior, or about a student who may be a danger to themselves or to others. If you wish to speak to someone confidentially who is not a mandatory reporter, you can schedule an appointment with one of the counselors in the Ebersole Health and Wellbeing Center or contact the College Chaplain, Rev. Melea White, at mwhite@cornelllcollege.edu.",

    "text": "Example: Sex discrimination in bank salaries. In the 1970’s, Harris Trust was sued for sex discrimination in the salaries it paid its employees. One approach to addressing this issue was to examine the starting salaries of all skilled, entry-level clerical workers between 1965 and 1975. The data is saved under banksalary.csv, and relevant R code can be found in the STA363_inst_files folder on the home directory of the RStudio Server. banksalary.qmd.\nFirst, we will speculate on what we expect to find and then we will perform an analysis using the data.\nRead the data in and use aview() to see the data, but do not do anything else with the data on the computer until question 6.\n\nIdentify the observational units, the response variable, and explanatory variables.\nGiven the mean starting salary of male workers ($5957) was 16% higher than the mean starting salary of female workers ($5139): Is this enough evidence to conclude sex discrimination exists? If not, what further evidence would you need?\nHow would you expect age, experience, and education to each be related to starting salary?\nWhy might it be important to control for seniority (number of years with the bank) if we are only concerned with the salary when the worker started?\nDo you expect any explanatory variables (including sex) to be closely related to each other? What implications would this have for modeling?\n\nUsing the data…\nOne approach is to construct a good model for beginning salaries while requiring sex as a predictor, to determine the significance of sex after controlling for the other covariates. Then we can explore interactions with sex to see if its effect is consistent across levels of other predictors.\n\nUse the data to address the primary question of interest here using only the beginning salary and sex variables. Be sure to discuss plots and summary statistics first, and then look at test(s) of significance.\nConstruct plots to investigate how each of the potential confounders (age, experience, education) is related to beginning salaries. Describe your findings.\nDoes seniority play a role in the variation of starting salaries? In what way?\nExamine how the explanatory variables (including sex) are related to each other, if at all. What implications would this have for modeling?\nFit a simple linear regression model with starting salary as the response and education as the sole explanatory variable. Interpret the intercept and slope of this model; also interpret the R-squared value. Is there a significant relationship between education and starting salary?\n\nIntercept:\nSlope:\nR2\nSignificance:\n\nDoes model1 from question 10 meet all linear regression assumptions? List each assumption and how you decided if it was met or not.\nIs a model with all 4 confounding variables better than a model with just education? Justify with an appropriate significance test in addition to summary statistics of model performance.\nYou should have noticed that the term for age was not significant in the model3. What does this imply about age and about future modeling steps?\nThe relationship between experience and beginning salary exhibits some curvature. How might it be interpreted in this context? Determine whether a quadratic term in experience improves a model without curvature.\nBased on model6, what conclusions can be drawn about sex discrimination at Harris Trust? Do these conclusions have to be qualified at all, or are they pretty clear cut? Interpret a 95% confidence interval for the male indicator variable in context to help with your response.\nDo any explanatory variables exhibit an interaction with sex. If so, what are the implications for your answer in (15)?\nOften salary data is logged before analysis. Would you recommend logging starting salary in this study? Support your decision analytically.\nRegardless of your answer to (17), provide an interpretation for the coefficient for the male coefficient in model6a after logging starting salary."

    "text": "Exercise 2\n\n(C16) Poisson approximation: rare events. For rare diseases, the probability of a case occurring, \\(p\\), in a very large population, \\(n\\), is small. With a small \\(p\\) and large \\(n\\), the random variable \\(Y\\)= the number of cases out of \\(n\\) people can be approximated using a Poisson random variable with \\(\\lambda = np\\). If the count of those with the disease is observed in several different populations independently of one another, the \\(Y_i\\) represents the number of cases in the \\(i^{th}\\) population and can be approximated using a Poisson random variable with \\(\\lambda_i=n_ip_i\\) where \\(p_i\\) is the probability of a case for the \\(i^{th}\\) population. Poisson regression can take into account the differences in the population sizes, \\(n_i\\), using as an offset log(\\(n_i\\)) as well as differences in a population characteristic like \\(x_i\\). The coefficient of the offset is set at one; it is not estimated like the other coefficients. Thus the model statement has the form: \\(log(\\lambda_i) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i + log(n_i)\\), where \\(Y_i  \\sim\\) Poisson(\\(\\lambda_i = n_i p_i\\)). Note that \\(\\lambda_i\\) depends on \\(x_i\\) which may differ for the different populations.\n@Scotto1974 wondered if skin cancer rates by age group differ by city. Based on their data in Table 2, identify and describe the following quantities which appear in the description of the Poisson approximation for rare events:\n\nA case,\nThe population size, \\(n_i\\),\nProbability, \\(p_i\\),\nPoisson parameter, \\(\\lambda_i\\),\nPoisson random variables, \\(Y_i\\), and\nThe predictors, \\(X_i\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Data from Scotto et al.

Why?\nThe height of a likelihood curve is the probability of the data for the given parameter. The horizontal axis represents different possible parameter values. Does the area under the likelihood curve for an interval from .25 to .75 equal the probability that the true probability of a boy is between 0.25 and 0.75?\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n(C2) Suppose the families with an “only child” were excluded for the Sex Conditional Model. How might the estimates for the three parameters be affected? Would it still be possible to perform a Likelihood Ratio Test to compare the Sex Unconditional and Sex Conditional Models? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n(G2) Case 3 In Case 1 we used hypothetical data with 30 boys and 20 girls. Case 2 was a much larger study with 600 boys and 400 girls.

That is, there is no empirical evidence that shooters have stretches where they are more likely to make consecutive shots, and basketball shots are essentially independent events. One of the many ways they tested for evidence of a “hot hand” was to record sequences of shots for players under game conditions and determine if players are more likely to make shots after made baskets than after misses. For instance, assume we recorded data from one player’s first 5 three-point attempts over a 5-game period. We can assume games are independent, but we’ll consider two models for shots within a game:\n\nNo Hot Hand (1 parameter): \\(p_B\\) = probability of making a basket (thus \\(1-p_B\\) = probability of not making a basket).\nHot Hand (2 parameters): \\(p_B\\) = probability of making a basket after a miss (or the first shot of a game); \\(p_{B|B}\\) = probability of making a basket after making the previous shot.\n\n\nFill out Table @ref(tab:hothandchp2)—write out the contribution of each game to the likelihood for both models along with the total likelihood for each model.\nGiven that, for the No Hot Hand model, \\(\\textrm{Lik}(p_B)=p_B^{10}(1-p_B)^{15}\\) for the 5 games where we collected data, how do we know that 0.40 (the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of \\(p_B\\)) is a better estimate than, say, 0.30?\nFind the MLEs for the parameters in each model, and then use those MLEs to determine if there’s significant evidence that the hot hand exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData for Open-ended Exercise 2.

How does age affect male elephant mating patterns? An article by @Poole1989 investigated whether mating success in male elephants increases with age and whether there is a peak age for mating success. To address this question, the research team followed 41 elephants for one year and recorded both their ages and their number of matings. The data [@Ramsey2002] is found in elephant.csv, and the variables are:\n\nMATINGS = the number of matings in a given year\nAGE = the age of the elephant in years.\n\n\nCreate a histogram of MATINGS. Is there preliminary evidence that number of matings could be modeled as a Poisson response? Explain.\nPlot MATINGS by AGE. Add a least squares line. Is there evidence that modeling matings using a linear regression with age might not be appropriate? Explain. (Hints: fit a smoother; check residual plots).\nFor each age, calculate the mean number of matings. Take the log of each mean and plot it by AGE.\n\nWhat assumption can be assessed with this plot?\nIs there evidence of a quadratic trend on this plot?\n\nFit a Poisson regression model with a linear term for AGE. Exponentiate and then interpret the coefficient for AGE.\nConstruct a 95% confidence interval for the slope and interpret in context (you may want to exponentiate endpoints).\nAre the number of matings significantly related to age? Test with\n\na Wald test and\na drop in deviance test.\n\nAdd a quadratic term in AGE to determine whether there is a maximum age for the number of matings for elephants. Is a quadratic model preferred to a linear model? To investigate this question, use\n\na Wald test and\na drop in deviance test.\n\nWhat can we say about the goodness-of-fit of the model with age as the sole predictor? Compare the residual deviance for the linear model to a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with the residual model degrees of freedom.\nFit the linear model using quasi-Poisson regression. (Why?)\n\nHow do the estimated coefficients change?\nHow do the standard errors change?\nWhat is the estimated dispersion parameter?\nAn estimated dispersion parameter greater than 1 suggests overdispersion.

To estimate the effects of the type of daycare on respiratory health in preschool children.\nMethods. A population-based, cross-sectional study of Oslo children born in 1992 was conducted at the end of 1996. A self-administered questionnaire inquired about daycare arrangements, environmental conditions, and family characteristics (n = 3853; response rate, 79%).\nResults. In a logistic regression controlling for confounding, children in daycare centers had more often nightly cough (adjusted odds ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval 1.34-2.67), and blocked or runny nose without common cold (1.55; 1.07-1.61) during the past 12 months compared with children in home care.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n(C3) Construct a table and calculate the corresponding odds and odds ratios. Comment on the reported and calculated results in this New York Times article from @Kolata2009.\n\nIn November, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a paper reporting that babies conceived with IVF, or with a technique in which sperm are injected directly into eggs, have a slightly increased risk of several birth defects, including a hole between the two chambers of the heart, a cleft lip or palate, an improperly developed esophagus and a malformed rectum. The study involved 9,584 babies with birth defects and 4,792 babies without. Among the mothers of babies without birth defects, 1.1% had used IVF or related methods, compared with 2.4% of mothers of babies with birth defects.\nThe findings are considered preliminary, and researchers say they believe IVF does not carry excessive risks. There is a 3% chance that any given baby will have a birth defect.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n(G4) Birdkeeping and lung cancer: a retrospective observational study. A 1972-1981 health survey in The Hague, Netherlands, discovered an association between keeping pet birds and increased risk of lung cancer. To investigate birdkeeping as a risk factor, researchers conducted a case-control study of patients in 1985 at four hospitals in The Hague. They identified 49 cases of lung cancer among patients who were registered with a general practice, who were age 65 or younger, and who had resided in the city since 1965. Each patient (case) with cancer was matched with two control subjects (without cancer) by age and sex. Further details can be found in @Holst1988.\nAge, sex, and smoking history are all known to be associated with lung cancer incidence. Thus, researchers wished to determine after age, sex, socioeconomic status, and smoking have been controlled for, is an additional risk associated with birdkeeping? The data [@Ramsey2002] is found in birdkeeping.csv, and the variables are listed below. In addition, R code at the end of the problem can be used to input the data and create additional useful variables.\n\nfemale = sex (1 = Female, 0 = Male)\nage = age, in years\nhighstatus = socioeconomic status (1 = High, 0 = Low), determined by the occupation of the household’s primary wage earner\nyrsmoke = years of smoking prior to diagnosis or examination\ncigsday = average rate of smoking, in cigarettes per day\nbird = indicator of birdkeeping (1 = Yes, 0 = No), determined by whether or not there were caged birds in the home for more than 6 consecutive months from 5 to 14 years before diagnosis (cases) or examination (controls)\ncancer = indicator of lung cancer diagnosis (1 = Cancer, 0 = No Cancer)\n\n\nPerform an exploratory data analysis to see how each explanatory variable is related to the response (cancer). Summarize each relationship in one sentence.\n\nFor quantitative explanatory variables (age, yrsmoke, cigsday), produce a cdplot, a boxplot, and summary statistics by cancer diagnosis.\nFor categorical explanatory variables (female or sex, highstatus or socioecon_status, bird or keep_bird), produce a segmented bar chart and an appropriate table of proportions showing the relationship with cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn (a), you should have found no relationship between whether or not a patient develops lung cancer and either their age or sex. Why might this be? What implications will this have on your modeling?\nBased on a two-way table with keeping birds and developing lung cancer from (a), find an unadjusted odds ratio comparing birdkeepers to non-birdkeepers and interpret this odds ratio in context. (Note: an unadjusted odds ratio is found by not controlling for any other variables.) Also, find an analogous relative risk and interpret it in context as well.\nAre the elogits reasonably linear relating number of years smoked to the estimated log odds of developing lung cancer? Demonstrate with an appropriate plot.\nDoes there appear to be an interaction between number of years smoked and whether the subject keeps a bird? Demonstrate with an interaction plot and a coded scatterplot with empirical logits on the y-axis.\n\n\n\nBefore answering the next questions, fit logistic regression models in R with cancer as the response and the following sets of explanatory variables:\n  i. `model1` = `age`, `yrsmoke`, `cigsday`, `female`, `highstatus`, `bird`\n  ii. `model2` = `yrsmoke`, `cigsday`, `highstatus`, `bird` \n  iii. `model4` = `yrsmoke`, `bird`\n  iv. `model5` = the complete second order version of `model4` (add squared terms and an interaction)\n  v. `model6` = `yrsmoke`, `bird`, `yrsmoke:bird`\n\nf. Is there evidence that we can remove `age` and `female` from our model?  Perform an appropriate test comparing `model1` to `model2`; give a test statistic and p-value, and state a conclusion in context.\n\ng. Is there evidence that the complete second order version of `model4` improves its performance?

Then tell if you prefer `model4` with years smoked as a numeric predictor or `model4a` with years smoked as a categorical predictor, and explain your reasoning.\n\nm. Discuss the scope of inference in this study.  Can we generalize our findings beyond the subjects in this study?  Can we conclude that birdkeeping causes increased odds of developing lung cancer?  Do you have other concerns with this study design or the analysis you carried out?\n\nn. Read the article that appeared in the *British Medical Journal*.

    "text": "Questions\n\nIdentify the observational units, the response variable, and explanatory variables.\nGiven the mean starting salary of male workers ($5957) was 16% higher than the mean starting salary of female workers ($5139): Is this enough evidence to conclude sex discrimination exists? If not, what further evidence would you need?\nHow would you expect age, experience, and education to each be related to starting salary?\nWhy might it be important to control for seniority (number of years with the bank) if we are only concerned with the salary when the worker started?\nDo you expect any explanatory variables (including sex) to be closely related to each other? What implications would this have for modeling?\n\nUsing the data…\nOne approach is to construct a good model for beginning salaries while requiring sex as a predictor, to determine the significance of sex after controlling for the other covariates. Then we can explore interactions with sex to see if its effect is consistent across levels of other predictors.\n\nUse the data to address the primary question of interest here using only the beginning salary and sex variables. Be sure to discuss plots and summary statistics first, and then look at test(s) of significance.\nConstruct plots to investigate how each of the potential confounders (age, experience, education) is related to beginning salaries. Describe your findings.\nDoes seniority play a role in the variation of starting salaries? In what way?\nExamine how the explanatory variables (including sex) are related to each other, if at all. What implications would this have for modeling?\nFit a simple linear regression model with starting salary as the response and education as the sole explanatory variable. Interpret the intercept and slope of this model; also interpret the R-squared value. Is there a significant relationship between education and starting salary?\n\nIntercept:\nSlope:\nR2\nSignificance:\n\nDoes model1 from question 10 meet all linear regression assumptions? List each assumption and how you decided if it was met or not.\nIs a model with all 4 confounding variables better than a model with just education? Justify with an appropriate significance test in addition to summary statistics of model performance.\nYou should have noticed that the term for age was not significant in the model3. What does this imply about age and about future modeling steps?\nThe relationship between experience and beginning salary exhibits some curvature. How might it be interpreted in this context? Determine whether a quadratic term in experience improves a model without curvature.\nBased on model6, what conclusions can be drawn about sex discrimination at Harris Trust? Do these conclusions have to be qualified at all, or are they pretty clear cut? Interpret a 95% confidence interval for the male indicator variable in context to help with your response.\nDo any explanatory variables exhibit an interaction with sex. If so, what are the implications for your answer in (15)?\nOften salary data is logged before analysis. Would you recommend logging starting salary in this study? Support your decision analytically.\nRegardless of your answer to (17), provide an interpretation for the coefficient for the male coefficient in model6a after logging starting salary."

The data is found in bites.csv, and relevant R code can be found below.\nVariables include:\n\nlunar.cycle = period of lunar cycle (1-10), where 10 = full moon\nn.days = number of days in that period\nn.bites = number of patients presenting with an animal bite during that period"

    "text": "Questions\n\nIs there initial evidence of more bites during full moon phases?\nWhy can’t we just perform a t-test comparing full moon periods to non-full moon periods using period-level data (n=10)?\nWhat options can you think of for handling the fact that Period 5 is based on only 2 lunar days? What are the modeling implications of including number of days in a period as an offset term?\nInterpret model parameters from fit1.\nIs there any evidence of lack of fit in fit1? What factors may lead to lack of fit?\nDoes full moon have an effect above and beyond the linear cycle trend? Interpret the coefficient and a 95% confidence interval for the fullmoon term in fit3.\nWhat is fit4 doing? Does it offer an improvement over fit3?\nWhat evidence is there that fit5 (which uses bitesbyday.csv) is the analysis performed by the authors of this paper?\nBased on this analysis, does it make you more wary of animal bites during full moons?\n\n\nAddressing issues of overdispersion in fit5.\n\nIs there evidence of lack of fit in fit5? Cite evidence both from a goodness of fit test and from comparing means and variances by period.\nIf overdispersion goes uncorrected, what are implications for p-values and CIs for model coefficients?\n\n\nOverdispersion parameter adjustment.\nOne solution is to simply add a second parameter to inflate variances, so that \\(Var(Y_i)=\\phi\\lambda_i\\). This is called a “quasi-Poisson” or, in general, a “quasi-likelihood” approach, because our data no longer follows a true Poisson distribution.\n\n\nNegative binomial modeling.\nAnother solution is to model response using a negative binomial distribution, so that \\(Y\\sim NegBinom(\\theta,p)\\). This distribution comes about if \\(Y|λ\\sim Poisson(λ)\\), but the \\(\\lambda\\)’s themselves are randomly chosen according to a gamma distribution: \\(\\lambda \\sim gamma(θ,\\frac{(1-p)}{p})\\). In this case, $E(Y)==$ and \\(Var(Y)=\\theta \\frac{p}{(1-p)^2} =\\mu+\\frac{\\mu^2}{\\theta}\\), so that \\(\\frac{\\mu^2}{\\theta}\\) is the amount of overdispersion.\n\nCompare the following estimates, tests, and intervals under usual Poisson regression, quasi-Poisson regression, and negative binomial regression:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoisson\nQuasi-poisson\nNegative Binomial\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\phi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(SE(\\hat{\\beta}_4\\))\n\n\n\n\n\nWald-type test stat\n\n\n\n\n\nWald-type p-value\n\n\n\n\n\nLRT-type test stat\n\n\n\n\n\nLRT-type test stat\n\n\n\n\n\nLRT-type p-value\n\n\n\n\n\nCI - profile for \\(e^{\\beta_4}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nCI-Wald-type for \\(e^{\\beta_4}\\)"

    "text": "Introduction\nAn article in the Journal of Animal Ecology by Bishop (1972) investigated whether moths provide evidence of “survival of the fittest” with their camouflage traits. Researchers glued equal numbers of light and dark morph moths in lifelike positions on tree trunks at 7 locations from 0 to 51.2 km from Liverpool. They then recorded the numbers of moths removed after 24 hours, presumably by predators. The hypothesis was that, since tree trunks near Liverpool were blackened by pollution, light morph moths would be more likely to be removed near Liverpool. The data is found in moth.csv, and relevant R code can be found under Moths.Rmd. Variables include:\n\nMOPRH = light or dark\nDISTANCE = kilometers from Liverpool\nPLACED = number of moths of a specific morph glued to trees at that location\nREMOVED = number of moths of a specific morph removed after 24 hours"
